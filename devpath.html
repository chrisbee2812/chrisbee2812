    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>We need to go back a long time for the start of my journey. Back to the 1980s when my family got our first computer, a BBC Micro Model B.
        This started a passion which stayed with me over the years.</p>
   
   
      <p>On that first computer I would write programs, well, mostly I would copy programs from a magazine and then edit them somewhat to suit what
       I envisioned and wanted from the program. Of course that language used was 'BBC Basic'. Amazingly enough this was developed and released for
       use in 1981, and is still available today to download for all modern operating systems, including Android and iOS.</p>
   
   
      <p>Due to growing up and teenage years, that spell in my life passed, that was until my future step dad, who worked for IBM at the time, brought a computer to our house.
       Although initially I would use it for games, I soon discovered Microsoft Basic, and started 'playing' with code. In a few years this moved onto
       Visual Basic.</p>
      
      <p>In my early 20s I started working in IT. However, the work I more naturally evolved into was IT support. There is no denying I had a natural aptitude
       for computers. In my early days I was focused on Novell Netware, I would fix PCs, and even peripheral hardware. Windows NT came out and it was obvious from the early
       days that was the way IT was heading, again I naturally went down the route of working with Windows NT. At the time I didn't really think about the fact that much
       of what I was doing in my day to day job turned to scripting and automating many of my more common tasks. One day I’d started a contract with a bank who were
       migrating users to an new Windows NT system. My task was to create the new user accounts on the NT system. After a few days I had created a script allowing me to
       run a single command line and have all of that day's accounts created in a minute or so (systems did work much more slowly back then, we were only looking at about
       a hundred accounts each day). The manager of the team where I was working back then was impressed with what I had done, to me what I had done was 'normal'.
       Unfortunately they could not do more accounts each day, due to the security of the system and the need to ensure all new users were working efficiently on the
       new system. To cut a short story even shorter, I became the company's go to guy for automation. I realised then the real importance of scripting. My focus was set.</p>
   
   
      <p>As the years went by I became a consultant in Microsoft Exchange. Specifically I worked with large companies who were wanting to migrate from and older email system
       to a more modern Microsoft Exchange system. With this work came PowerShell scripting. I took to this like a duck to water. And when working on migrating over 100k users
       from one system to another as I regularly found myself doing, it became essential.</p>
   
   
      <p>It was whilst working on one such project, a project manager came to me and asked if it was possible to add some functionality into MS Outlook to automate a particular calendar
       process. I recall looking at him and saying as I would, 'everything is possible', however, this time I added, 'but not by me with my current skill set'. That evening, as
       I tend to do whilst unwinding, I was thinking about the conversation, and thought to myself that with a little bit of learning that could be a task I was more than capable
       of doing (one of the things I love to do is to learn new skills!). I started investigating how to go about such a task, I downloaded MS Visual Studio and started to learn
       a little more about the .NET Framework and C#. PowerShell, using the .NET Framework, provided a good grounding of Microsoft’s general syntax usage, and things started to slot together.</p>
   
   
      <p>Things in my life started to take a turn. I set up my own gardening company, leaving IT (or so I thought) behind. I found myself needing a website, I quickly created one using a
       WYSIWYG tool, but was never really happy with what I had created. This led to me learning HTML when I had free time available. Obviously with the basic site in place, HTML helped a bit
      in understanding what was there, but was limited as to what more I could do to improve the look and feel of the website. And so I learned CSS, excellent, I could improve the look and
      feel of the website. I started to look into JavaScript in order to increase the functionality of the website.</p>
   
   
      <p>For various reasons outside of my control, the company took a tumble (see the <a href="aboutme.html">about me</a> page for more info). Finances took a major hit and it became a
       struggle to get the company going again. I started spending more time at my mother's place in France (as she is getting older she needs the help around her garden! I'll never stop gardening),
       and closed the company down. Post Brexit, being unable to work in France without
      a visa and limited to 90 days in every 180 days in France, I now return to the UK for 90 days picking up work where I can to earn a bit of money to see me through my next stint in France. 
      I soon decided my best option was to find work I could do in the UK, but do it from France. As I had learnt much in the last few years about software development
      I decided that software development was probably the way to go.</p>
   
   
      <p>I soon started learning Python as it seemed to be a major player. I then started really hitting HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using <a href="w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> 
        for all of these languages, as well as books from <a href=”https://www.cuantum.tech/”>Cuantum</a>. I am now
       currently studying with <a href="codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> working through their Full-Stack Engineer course. Hopefully by the end of the year I will have started a full-time job working as a junior
       developer for a UK company, where they allow me to work from France.</p>
   
   
      <p>Where do I see my future software development going? Well first I wish to finish my Codecademy course. Once I have a certificate from them I may sign up officially to W3Schools,
       and start completing some of their certificates, or I may look at what other offerings Codecademy have.
       When I know I have a regular income I will start to complete one of my bucket list items, and start working towards a Masters Degree,
       undoubtedly in an IT related field. And for some reason, I feel a draw to learning Java development along my path</p>
