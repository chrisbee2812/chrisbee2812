        <p>An intro to me... Not something I've thought about writing until now. I suppose I could start by telling all that my name is, Chris. Then again that's what i'm called when in the UK.
        Right now I'm sat at my desk in France, where the locals all call me by my full name, Christopher. But having come to my website I'd expect that you already know my name without me
         having to tell you that here. Please do read on, as there is a raft of information about my past here.
        </p>
      <div id="div_aboutMe_to_hide">
        <p>So, not wanting to write a novel, I'll try to keep it brief.</p>
        <p>Born, late December 1972, Pembroke Dock Hospital, Pembrokeshire, Wales.</p>


        <p>So, the big question, do I consider my self as being Welsh? Deep down, and seeing as I was born in Wales, I suppose I have to. However, I feel most Welsh would
     laugh at me even contemplating the possibility of me being Welsh.</p>


        <p>Having moved from Wales, to England at the age of 2 years, and only ever having been back to Wales a handful of times to visit, on the surface I'm English,
     or maybe better, British.</p>


        <p>So, before I get too engrossed in my history. Let me quickly tell you that I am one of five. Three brothers (two older and one younger) and one sister (older).</p>


        <p>We moved to England, to a lovely place called Steep Marsh, just outside of Petersfield in Hampshire. The house we lived in was a great big farm house, the
     original part of which was built in 1656. Although the address was Steep Marsh, we actually lived closer to the village of
     Sheet. And so my siblings and I (when old enough) all attended Sheet County Primary School. They were most definitely different times. But then I imagine most
     people, even those half my age would look back at their primary school years and think the same. We could play conkers in the play ground, we could play British
     Bulldogs at break. When we got to the last year of school, the year group our headmaster taught, he would notify us it was break time by sitting at his desk and
     lighting a cigarette!</p>


        <p>Our house was a stones throw away from that of the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Guinness" target="_blank">Sir Alec Guinness</a>. Myself and my younger brother used to go there to do 'Bob A Job'. All good and well until
    one Autumn when they got us to rake up all the fallen leaves from the trees. They had a lot of trees. Our Sunday lunches tended to be spent at <a href="https://www.theharrowinnsteep.co.uk/">the Harrow Inn</a>, a pub
     like few others in the country, and one which holds fond memories for most who ever ventured there. My mother to this day still makes a good 'Harrow Soup'. My siblings
     and I would spend much of our time at Kettle Brook, playing Pooh sticks under the bridge whilst our parents drank and got merry at the pub. The rest of our weekends
     would mostly be spent running wild. We had free run of the fields around our house, not to mention a very large garden, with a large barn and several other out buildings
      where as young children we could let our energy lose and minds run free.</p>


        <p>Of course we slowly grow up. I breezed through primary school, and sat the entrance exam to a local public school, Churcher's College. Eventually the news came
     through that I had been accepted into the school, not only accepted but I had done enough to earn myself a scholarship. A public, all boys secondary school was quite
    a change from a quaint little state run co-educational primary school. All of my friends from primary school had gone to the local state comprehensive school. However,
     I settled in quickly and made plenty of new friends. As school progressed I joined the Army section of the Combined Cadets Force, by the time I finished at the school
     I had made the rank of sergeant. I joined the school archery club, which led to me joining the local town's archery club for whom I won several gold medals.</p>


        <p>I left the school with a very good set of GCSEs. However, classroom education didn't really seem to be for me. And so I found my way onto an HND course studying marine
     engineering, at the maritime college in Warsash, now a part of the Solent University. Whilst there I was sponsored by Chevron Oil Corporation. We learnt a whole spectrum
    of skills on the course from graphic design and firefighting, to welding and machinery. During and after the course I travelled the world with Chevron, visiting Dubai,
    Hong Kong, Cape Town, Aruba, Galveston, San Francisco, Quinhuangdao and so many more incredible places.</p>


        <p>It wasn't long until I moved away from Chevron and the sea. The IT skills I had picked up on my course enabled me to get a job working for a small IT company. This was
    the start of my career in IT. After a couple of years and the realisation that the company had little interest in investing in my future, I completed a boot camp course
   in Novell Netware, and became a certified CNA in Novell Netware 3.5. The first of many IT certifications I would be awarded over the years. For the most part
    of my IT working years I would take on short term contracts, finding myself working for some incredible companies.</p>


        <p>Back then I was an avid gym goer, and decided that I would go for one of my bucket list items. I was offered a place on the London Marathon. Of course I took the place
     and ran the marathon, raising nearly Â£2000 for St John Ambulance. And completing it in a not too shabby 3hrs 42mins. That same year I met the mother of my two wonderful
     children. My daughter was born in the September of 2002 (the same year my mother moved to France), my son followed in the February of 2004.</p>


        <p>At that time I was living my life in the beautiful seaside town of Bournemouth. When my wife and I decided to part ways, work took me to Salisbury, where I spent the
    next twelve years of my life. Continuing to work doing short term contracts in IT, continuing to love the gym. I started to spend more time in the amazing city of London
     due to work, meeting wonderful people all the way. As my children started to get older, I decided I wanted to be back closer to them, and moved to Christchurch (no not
     the one in New Zealand, the one next to Bournemouth!).</p>


        <p>Shortly after I moved to Christchurch, I decided to try out something I had always wanted to do, run my own gardening business. And so the adventure began. I quickly
     managed to fill up my time having picked up some amazing customers in next to no time. Better still, my son had moved into my house as it was much closer to his school
     and friends. Life really was looking good. I was doing my own thing, working outside in the fresh air and have my children around me. Then disaster struck, my son's
     kidney (we new at an early stage he only had one and that wouldn't last) started to fail. Thankfully he had a match, someone could donate him a kidney, <strong>ME</strong>. We had a
      date for the transplant set, then Covid came. The operation was cancelled. He started dialysis in Southampton. Three times a week I would drive him over to the hospital
      to sit and wait four hours until his session was completed. I really can't start to explain just how brilliant in every way the staff at the hospital were through out.
     At the end of the first lock down, we were set a date for the transplant.</p>


        <p>Covid was still about, hospitals were still being very cautious. My son still being under 18 was taken to the Evelina Children's hospital in London. As Guys hospital had
     covid cases I was sent to a covid free private hospital, the London Bridge hospital. 29th June 2020, I did one of the most amazing things one human could ever do for
    another (yes I am proud of what I did that day, I am proud and grateful for every individual who has ever donated an organ to save another's life, and will be forever),
    I had my left kidney removed. My son has been doing incredibly well ever since.</p>


        <p>Recovering from a major operation and the ongoing impact of Covid really didn't go well with running my own very small company. I started to wonder about what
    my future really held and where I wanted to be heading. I started spending more time at my mother's place in France, and started studying again, with the aim to get back
    into IT, only this time, to give me more freedom, studying to be a software developer. Now I spend as much time as I can in France (90 days in every 180), and will
    hopefully soon be in a position to obtain a visa with the aim to be here more permanently.

    <div class="cb-padding-16">
      <p>My professional life, taking us from the early days of work all the way through to the present. Hopefully i'll provide some insight as to where i plan to be soon.</p>
      <div id="div_professional_to_hide">
        <p>We need to go back a long time for the start of my journey. Back to the 1980s when my family got our first computer, a BBC Micro Model B.
          This started a passion which stayed with me over the years.</p>
     
     
        <p>On that first computer I would write programs, well, mostly I would copy programs from a magazine and then edit them somewhat to suit what
         I envisioned and wanted from the program. Of course that language used was 'BBC Basic'. Amazingly enough this was developed and released for
         use in 1981, and is still available today to download for all modern operating systems, including Android and iOS.</p>
     
     
        <p>Due to growing up and teenage years, that spell in my life passed, that was until my future step dad, who worked for IBM at the time, brought a computer to our house.
         Although initially I would use it for games, I soon discovered Microsoft Basic, and started 'playing' with code. In a few years this moved onto
         Visual Basic.</p>
        
        <p>In my early 20s I started working in IT. However, the work I more naturally evolved into was IT support. There is no denying I had a natural aptitude
         for computers. In my early days I was focused on Novell Netware, I would fix PCs, and even peripheral hardware. Windows NT came out and it was obvious from the early
         days that was the way IT was heading, again I naturally went down the route of working with Windows NT. At the time I didn't really think about the fact that much
         of what I was doing in my day to day job turned to scripting and automating many of my more common tasks. One day Iâd started a contract with a bank who were
         migrating users to an new Windows NT system. My task was to create the new user accounts on the NT system. After a few days I had created a script allowing me to
         run a single command line and have all of that day's accounts created in a minute or so (systems did work much more slowly back then, we were only looking at about
         a hundred accounts each day). The manager of the team where I was working back then was impressed with what I had done, to me what I had done was 'normal'.
         Unfortunately they could not do more accounts each day, due to the security of the system and the need to ensure all new users were working efficiently on the
         new system. To cut a short story even shorter, I became the company's go to guy for automation. I realised then the real importance of scripting. My focus was set.</p>
     
     
        <p>As the years went by I became a consultant in Microsoft Exchange. Specifically I worked with large companies who were wanting to migrate from and older email system
         to a more modern Microsoft Exchange system. With this work came PowerShell scripting. I took to this like a duck to water. And when working on migrating over 100k users
         from one system to another as I regularly found myself doing, it became essential.</p>
     
     
        <p>It was whilst working on one such project, a project manager came to me and asked if it was possible to add some functionality into MS Outlook to automate a particular calendar
         process. I recall looking at him and saying as I would, 'everything is possible', however, this time I added, 'but not by me with my current skill set'. That evening, as
         I tend to do whilst unwinding, I was thinking about the conversation, and thought to myself that with a little bit of learning that could be a task I was more than capable
         of doing (one of the things I love to do is to learn new skills!). I started investigating how to go about such a task, I downloaded MS Visual Studio and started to learn
         a little more about the .NET Framework and C#. PowerShell, using the .NET Framework, provided a good grounding of Microsoftâs general syntax usage, and things started to slot together.</p>
     
     
        <p>Things in my life started to take a turn. I set up my own gardening company, leaving IT (or so I thought) behind. I found myself needing a website, I quickly created one using a
         WYSIWYG tool, but was never really happy with what I had created. This led to me learning HTML when I had free time available. Obviously with the basic site in place, HTML helped a bit
        in understanding what was there, but was limited as to what more I could do to improve the look and feel of the website. And so I learned CSS, excellent, I could improve the look and
        feel of the website. I started to look into JavaScript in order to increase the functionality of the website.</p>
     
     
        <p>For various reasons outside of my control, the company took a tumble (see the <a href="aboutme.html">about me</a> page for more info). Finances took a major hit and it became a
         struggle to get the company going again. I started spending more time at my mother's place in France (as she is getting older she needs the help around her garden! I'll never stop gardening),
         and closed the company down. Post Brexit, being unable to work in France without
        a visa and limited to 90 days in every 180 days in France, I now return to the UK for 90 days picking up work where I can to earn a bit of money to see me through my next stint in France. 
        I soon decided my best option was to find work I could do in the UK, but do it from France. As I had learnt much in the last few years about software development
        I decided that software development was probably the way to go.</p>
     
     
        <p>I soon started learning Python as it seemed to be a major player. I then started really hitting HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Using <a href="w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> 
          for all of these languages, as well as books from <a href=âhttps://www.cuantum.tech/â>Cuantum</a>. I am now
         currently studying with <a href="codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> working through their Full-Stack Engineer course. Hopefully by the end of the year I will have started a full-time job working as a junior
         developer for a UK company, where they allow me to work from France.</p>
     
     
        <p>Where do I see my future software development going? Well first I wish to finish my Codecademy course. Once I have a certificate from them I may sign up officially to W3Schools,
         and start completing some of their certificates, or I may look at what other offerings Codecademy have.
         When I know I have a regular income I will start to complete one of my bucket list items, and start working towards a Masters Degree,
         undoubtedly in an IT related field. And for some reason, I feel a draw to learning Java development along my path</p>
