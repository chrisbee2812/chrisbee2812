        <p>An intro to me... Not something I've thought about writing until now. I suppose I could start by telling all that my name is, Chris. Then again that's what i'm called when in the UK.
        Right now I'm sat at my desk in France, where the locals all call me by my full name, Christopher. But having come to my website I'd expect that you already know my name without me
         having to tell you that here. Please do read on, as there is a raft of information about my past here.

      <div id="div_to_hide" class="collapse">
        <p>So, not wanting to write a novel, I'll try to keep it brief.</p>
        <p>Born, late December 1972, Pembroke Dock Hospital, Pembrokeshire, Wales.</p>


        <p>So, the big question, do I consider my self as being Welsh? Deep down, and seeing as I was born in Wales, I suppose I have to. However, I feel most Welsh would
     laugh at me even contemplating the possibility of me being Welsh.</p>


        <p>Having moved from Wales, to England at the age of 2 years, and only ever having been back to Wales a handful of times to visit, on the surface I'm English,
     or maybe better, British.</p>


        <p>So, before I get too engrossed in my history. Let me quickly tell you that I am one of five. Three brothers (two older and one younger) and one sister (older).</p>


        <p>We moved to England, to a lovely place called Steep Marsh, just outside of Petersfield in Hampshire. The house we lived in was a great big farm house, the
     original part of which was built in 1656. Although the address was Steep Marsh, we actually lived closer to the village of
     Sheet. And so my siblings and I (when old enough) all attended Sheet County Primary School. They were most definitely different times. But then I imagine most
     people, even those half my age would look back at their primary school years and think the same. We could play conkers in the play ground, we could play British
     Bulldogs at break. When we got to the last year of school, the year group our headmaster taught, he would notify us it was break time by sitting at his desk and
     lighting a cigarette!</p>


        <p>Our house was a stones throw away from that of the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Guinness" target="_blank">Sir Alec Guinness</a>. Myself and my younger brother used to go there to do 'Bob A Job'. All good and well until
    one Autumn when they got us to rake up all the fallen leaves from the trees. They had a lot of trees. Our Sunday lunches tended to be spent at <a href="https://www.theharrowinnsteep.co.uk/">the Harrow Inn</a>, a pub
     like few others in the country, and one which holds fond memories for most who ever ventured there. My mother to this day still makes a good 'Harrow Soup'. My siblings
     and I would spend much of our time at Kettle Brook, playing Pooh sticks under the bridge whilst our parents drank and got merry at the pub. The rest of our weekends
     would mostly be spent running wild. We had free run of the fields around our house, not to mention a very large garden, with a large barn and several other out buildings
      where as young children we could let our energy lose and minds run free.</p>


        <p>Of course we slowly grow up. I breezed through primary school, and sat the entrance exam to a local public school, Churcher's College. Eventually the news came
     through that I had been accepted into the school, not only accepted but I had done enough to earn myself a scholarship. A public, all boys secondary school was quite
    a change from a quaint little state run co-educational primary school. All of my friends from primary school had gone to the local state comprehensive school. However,
     I settled in quickly and made plenty of new friends. As school progressed I joined the Army section of the Combined Cadets Force, by the time I finished at the school
     I had made the rank of sergeant. I joined the school archery club, which led to me joining the local town's archery club for whom I won several gold medals.</p>


        <p>I left the school with a very good set of GCSEs. However, classroom education didn't really seem to be for me. And so I found my way onto an HND course studying marine
     engineering, at the maritime college in Warsash, now a part of the Solent University. Whilst there I was sponsored by Chevron Oil Corporation. We learnt a whole spectrum
    of skills on the course from graphic design and firefighting, to welding and machinery. During and after the course I travelled the world with Chevron, visiting Dubai,
    Hong Kong, Cape Town, Aruba, Galveston, San Francisco, Quinhuangdao and so many more incredible places.</p>


        <p>It wasn't long until I moved away from Chevron and the sea. The IT skills I had picked up on my course enabled me to get a job working for a small IT company. This was
    the start of my career in IT. After a couple of years and the realisation that the company had little interest in investing in my future, I completed a boot camp course
   in Novell Netware, and became a certified CNA in Novell Netware 3.5. The first of many IT certifications I would be awarded over the years. For the most part
    of my IT working years I would take on short term contracts, finding myself working for some incredible companies.</p>


        <p>Back then I was an avid gym goer, and decided that I would go for one of my bucket list items. I was offered a place on the London Marathon. Of course I took the place
     and ran the marathon, raising nearly £2000 for St John Ambulance. And completing it in a not too shabby 3hrs 42mins. That same year I met the mother of my two wonderful
     children. My daughter was born in the September of 2002 (the same year my mother moved to France), my son followed in the February of 2004.</p>


        <p>At that time I was living my life in the beautiful seaside town of Bournemouth. When my wife and I decided to part ways, work took me to Salisbury, where I spent the
    next twelve years of my life. Continuing to work doing short term contracts in IT, continuing to love the gym. I started to spend more time in the amazing city of London
     due to work, meeting wonderful people all the way. As my children started to get older, I decided I wanted to be back closer to them, and moved to Christchurch (no not
     the one in New Zealand, the one next to Bournemouth!).</p>


        <p>Shortly after I moved to Christchurch, I decided to try out something I had always wanted to do, run my own gardening business. And so the adventure began. I quickly
     managed to fill up my time having picked up some amazing customers in next to no time. Better still, my son had moved into my house as it was much closer to his school
     and friends. Life really was looking good. I was doing my own thing, working outside in the fresh air and have my children around me. Then disaster struck, my son's
     kidney (we new at an early stage he only had one and that wouldn't last) started to fail. Thankfully he had a match, someone could donate him a kidney, <strong>ME</strong>. We had a
      date for the transplant set, then Covid came. The operation was cancelled. He started dialysis in Southampton. Three times a week I would drive him over to the hospital
      to sit and wait four hours until his session was completed. I really can't start to explain just how brilliant in every way the staff at the hospital were through out.
     At the end of the first lock down, we were set a date for the transplant.</p>


        <p>Covid was still about, hospitals were still being very cautious. My son still being under 18 was taken to the Evelina Children's hospital in London. As Guys hospital had
     covid cases I was sent to a covid free private hospital, the London Bridge hospital. 29th June 2020, I did one of the most amazing things one human could ever do for
    another (yes I am proud of what I did that day, I am proud and grateful for every individual who has ever donated an organ to save another's life, and will be forever),
    I had my left kidney removed. My son has been doing incredibly well ever since.</p>


        <p>Recovering from a major operation and the ongoing impact of Covid really didn't go well with running my own very small company. I started to wonder about what
    my future really held and where I wanted to be heading. I started spending more time at my mother's place in France, and started studying again, with the aim to get back
    into IT, only this time, to give me more freedom, studying to be a software developer. Now I spend as much time as I can in France (90 days in every 180), and will
    hopefully soon be in a position to obtain a visa with the aim to be here more permanently.
