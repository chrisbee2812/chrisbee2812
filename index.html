    <div class="cb-padding-16">
      <p>An intro to me... Not something I've thought about writing until now. I suppose I could start by telling all that my name is, Chris. Then again that's what i'm called when in the UK.
        Right now I'm sat at my desk in France, where the locals all call me by my full name, Christopher. But having come to my website I'd expect that you already know my name without me
         having to tell you that here. Please do read on, as there is a raft of information about my past here.

      <p>So here i will gradually build up a portfolio of work done. I'll also be enhancing items as i find time to do so. The items that can be found within will hopefully be of
         interest to some, maybe even useful to others.
